# Contribution Guidelines

Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md). By participating in this project, you agree to abide by its terms.

These guidelines are adapted from those of [Awesome Node.js](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-nodejs) and [Awesome Electron](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-electron).

---

Please ensure that your pull request (PR) adheres to the following guidelines:

- Don't open a Draft/WIP PR while you are still working on the guidelines. A PR should be 100% ready and should adhere to all the guidelines when you open it.
- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Make an individual PR for each suggestion.
- Use the following format: `[title](link) - Description.`
- Additions should be added to the bottom of the relevant category.
- Link to the GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket repo (preferably), not [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/)/[pypi.org](https://pypi.org/) or its website.
- Keep descriptions short and to the point, but descriptive.
- Descriptions should not be marketing taglines.
- Descriptions should not be [title-case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_case).
- Start the description with a capital and end with a full stop/period.
- Don't start the description with `A` or `An`.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing space.
- The PR should have a useful title and include a link to the package and why it should be included.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome, but should be done in a separate PR.

Thank you for your suggestion!

## Updating your PR

A lot of times, making a PR adhere to the standards above can be difficult. If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to edit your PR before we merge it. If you're not sure how to do that, [here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md) on the different ways you can update your PR so that we can merge it.
